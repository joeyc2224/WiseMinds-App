        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Formula One is the highest level of single-seat car racing you can get, and as such
            enjoys immense investment and legions of fans from almost every country in the world.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: -30px;">Formula One is sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA)
            which was established on 20 June 1904. Formula One was inaugurated on 13 May 1950 as the World Drivers’
            Championship at Silverstone in the United Kingdom. In 1981 it became known as the FIA Formula One World
            Championship.<br><br>Several races called Grand Prix are held all over the world over a season. These races
            taken together are called a Formula One season. The word ‘Formula” refers to a set of rules that all
            participating teams have to adhere to. Grand Prix is a French word that translates as grand prize in
            English. The races are run of tracks that are graded “1” by the FIA. Hence the name Formula One was
            adopted.<br><br>The races take place on purpose-built tracks certified by the FIA. Most tracks are situated
            in remote locations well connected with cities. There are a few races such as the British Grand Prix and the
            Singapore Grand Prix that are held on closed public roads. Formula One is one of the premium forms of racing
            around the world and draws huge audiences.<br><br>A driver participating in a Formula One race should hold a
            valid Super Licence issued by the FIA. The performance of the drivers and the constructors of the car are
            evaluated at the end of each race by a points system. At the end of a season, the FIA aggregates the points
            scored by each and awards two annual World Championships: one each for the drivers and the constructors.</p>
